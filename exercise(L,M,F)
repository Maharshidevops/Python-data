Functional Programming Practice (Python)
1.	Lambda—Square Function
Write a lambda expression that returns the square of a given number.
2.	Map—Double Each Number
Given a list of numbers, use map to multiply every number by 2.
3.	Filter—Keep Even Numbers
Given a list of numbers, use filter to retain only the even numbers.
4.	Lambda + Map—Numbers to Strings
Use a lambda with map to convert a list of numbers into their string representations.
5.	Filter + Map—Squares of Positives Only
Given a list of numbers, first use filter to keep only positive numbers, then use map to return their squares.
6.	Filter—Remove Empty Strings
Given a list of strings, use filter to remove all empty strings (e.g., "" or strings with only whitespace).
7.	Map—Uppercase Words
Given a list of words, use map to convert each word to uppercase.
8.	Filter—Palindromic Strings
Given a list of strings, use filter to keep only the strings that are palindromes (case-insensitive).
9.	Map—Word Lengths
Given a sentence, split it into words and use map to extract the length of each word.
10.	(Optional Bonus) Compose Map/Filter
Combine map and filter to:
a) Remove non-numeric values from a mixed list, then
b) Convert the remaining numbers to their absolute values.
